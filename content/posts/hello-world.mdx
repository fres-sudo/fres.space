# Hello, World!

Welcome to my blog! I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you. This blog is built with Next.js and MDX, allowing me to write content in Markdown with JSX components.

## Why I Started This Blog

I believe in sharing knowledge and experiences. Through this blog, I aim to:

1. Share my learning journey
2. Help others learn from my experiences
3. Connect with the developer community

Stay tuned for more posts about web development, design, and technology!
